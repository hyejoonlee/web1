<h2>CSS란 무엇인가</h2>
I am <strong>learning <u>coding</u></strong> with youtube.
<p>I worked for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" target="_blank" title="what accessary means">accessary</a> and sundry goods store for 2 years as a part-time job. <br>As there was only one worker at the store, I managed everything that happens at the store.</p>
<p>I displayed products differently depending on the week rank of products sales, trend, and the weather. <br>I analyzed the product that is in great demand while I was serving customers. I applied the analysis result to the arrangement of the product in real time. I learned the importance to make customers see various products at a glance, and to arrange each of the products matching with other products in design and mood. At the same time, I tried not to miss customer’s concentration to the main items.
<p>To force<br> line breaks<br> in a text,<br> use the br<br> element.</p>
